    <h1>The Importance of Indented Code</h1>
    <p>
      Indented code is crucial for maintaining readability and organization,
      especially in collaborative environments. It helps developers quickly
      understand the structure of the code, find elements, and nested elements.
      Proper indentation visually separates different blocks of code, making it
      easier to identify relationships between functions, classes, and other
      components, ultimately reducing the chance of errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, well-indented code follows common best practices and
      standards, which are essential for teamwork and long-term maintenance of a
      project. When code is uniformly indented, it becomes easier for others to
      jump in, review, or modify it without confusion. This clarity improves
      communication between developers and enhances the overall quality of the
      project.
